                <p tabindex="0">The problem we face is how much water is wasted, whether it's washing your hands, flushing down the toilet or showering. An average toilet uses about 8 liters of water each time it is flushed. It corresponds to approx. 11 680 liters of
                    clean water per person every year. 780 million people live without pure water in the world, but we don't think about it because of all the great access we have to the water.

                    <p tabindex="0">We decided to do some research regarding outhouses, both in person and online. The result quickly showed that Clear was a big and important need for the people.
                    It showed that people do not like the outhouses that they are offered today, and most of them were surprised by our project and were very interested.

                            <p tabindex="0">Most people are not satisfied with the quality of outdoor toilets today, and many would like to see improvements made to them. One of the most common reasons for the dissatisfaction is related to hygiene. The foul smells and
                                the dirty toilet seats. But they are only the visible and negative sides of the toilets today. The most noticeable for the world and that should be looked after is water wastage, little modern technology in the toilets
                                today and little access to the outhouses in the center and elsewhere in the country. The results speak for themselves. People are more willing to use outhouses if Clear's modern, innovative and environmentally friendly
                                technology is installed.

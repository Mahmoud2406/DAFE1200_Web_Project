                    father who has always been interested in data and technology. Hamid is from a country where outhouses are common amongst all of the population, and they are far from clean and hygienic. This affected Hamid very much.</p>

                better which is what lead him to his position as Chief Operating Officer. From pessimistic to optimistic! From nothing to Chief Operating Officer of Clear!</p>

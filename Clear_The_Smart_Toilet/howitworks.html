                <p tabindex="0"> We introduce Clear. For us Norwegians, Clear might not seem like a necessity. We have the luxury of having clean water running almost constantly. Unfortunately, this is not the reality for most people, even in the west. Clear aims to preserve
                    the water we use to flush our toilets, and decrease our excessive water usage. Water scarcity is a serious threat in most parts of the west, for example the state of California. In this scenario, we can use Clear to help mitigate these
                    threats.

                    <p tabindex="0"> In addition to our Clear toilets, we introduce you to our app which allows you to locate nearby toilets. If you find some of the locations convenient, you could save them and instantly put them up as your destination, even without
                        any wifi connection. During the summer, our toilets use solar panels which makes them even more sustainable. There are also sensors that tell you if the toilet you are visitting has a full feces tank or not. If there is anything
                        you are wondering, you can contact us through the "help" section in the app.</p>

                <hr>
                <h3 tabindex="0">✔ Step 1</h3>
                <p tabindex="0"> When flushing, the feces and urine will be transported to a tank where they will be separated by a sedimentation prosess. This means that matter with a higher density will sink to the bottom and the liquid will stay on top. From here the
                    liquid will be pumped out of the tank to a tube, ready for the next step.</p>
                <h3 tabindex="0">✔ Step 2</h3>
                <p tabindex="0">In this step the liquid from step 1 will be transported from a tube to a new tank. Here it will go through an electrolysis prosess. The reason for this prosess is to produce chlorine, which is very efficient in killing germs. Chlorine
                    kills germs by breaking down their chemical compounds on a molecular level. With a lot of germs in the liquid from step 1, it’s important to kill as many as possible and as of today, Chlorine is the most common water disinfectant.
                    When the liquid has gone trough the electrolysis prosess, it will proceed to the next tube. </p>

                <h3 tabindex="0">✔ Step 3</h3>
                <p tabindex="0">When the liquid is transported from the electrolysis tank, it will proceed to a tube which is attached to a ceramic filter. The ceramic filter is capable of micro filtration filtering dust particles, turbidity and bacteria. The ceramic
                    filter also contains a sedimentation filter which removes small solids if made it so far. This filter will remove the chlorine from the water, making it clean and disinfected. </p>
                <h3 tabindex="0">✔ Step 4</h3>
                <p tabindex="0">After passing through the filter in step 3, the water will be stored in a water tank. </p>
                <h3 tabindex="0">✔ Step 5</h3>
                <p tabindex="0">Whenever needed, the water gets transported from the water tank to the toilet(s) that require more water.</p>
